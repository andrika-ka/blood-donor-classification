# Blood Donor Classification Pipeline

This machine learning project predicts whether a blood donor is suitable based on medical laboratory data.

## 💡 Project Overview

This pipeline simulates a real hospital scenario in three phases:
1. **Anomaly Detection**: Identifies unusual data points in patient records.
2. **Clustering**: Groups patients by similar health patterns.
3. **Classification**: Determines if a person is a blood donor or not, based on clean input data.

## 🧠 Technologies Used

- Python
- Scikit-Learn
- PCA, Decision Tree, Clustering
- ONNX (Model Export)
- Matplotlib, Pandas

## 📊 Results & Learnings

- Created a modular ML pipeline with explainable outputs
- Identified key medical features that influence donor classification
- Exported model with ONNX for production compatibility

## 📁 Files

- `Blood_Donor_Classification_Abgabe.ipynb`: Full pipeline
- `*.csv`: Input data for each phase
- `pca_model_phase1.pkl`: PCA model from phase 1

## 🔬 Real-World Application

Such a pipeline could support hospitals in early screening of suitable donors using automated lab-based triaging systems.
